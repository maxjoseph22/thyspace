## 🏰 ThySpace 🏰
Overview
ThySpace is a medieval-themed social networking web application inspired by Facebook. We developed it during our time at Makers as part of a collaborative bootcamp project. This was the first time we tackled JavaScript and React after just two weeks of learning the basics of both.

Our primary goal was to explore core web development concepts (routing, data models, user authentication, etc.) and sharpen our React skills by building a fun, fully functional web application.

Context and Motivation
Focus on Learning: Coming from limited JavaScript and React experience, we dove right in to learn how to build a front end using React components, state management, and basic integration with a backend API.
Team Collaboration: Working in small groups strengthened our communication, version control, and agile practices.
Medieval Twist: We gave our social network a medieval flair—featuring “alliances” (friends) and thematic design elements—to keep the project engaging while we refined our new skills.
Features
User Registration and Authentication: Users can sign up and log in securely.
Alliances (Friendships): Forge alliances with other users or break them if conflicts arise.
Posts (Wall Messages): Share posts on your page with your kingdom and allies.
Comments: Add witty or helpful comments on others’ posts.
Real-time Updates: Experience a seamless user interface that updates without page reloads.
Tech Stack
MongoDB: Database for users, alliances, posts, and comments.
Express.js: Handles server-side logic and routing.
React: Front-end library for building an interactive user interface.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime that powers the server and overall app logic.
Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Install MongoDB (macOS with Homebrew)
Tap the MongoDB Homebrew Repo

brew tap mongodb/brew
Install MongoDB

brew install mongodb-community@6.0
Note: If you see a message such as
"If you need to have mongodb-community@6.0 first in your PATH, run:"
follow that instruction, then restart your terminal.

Start MongoDB

brew services start mongodb-community@6.0
Alternatively, if you’re on a different operating system or prefer another method, follow the MongoDB official installation guide for your environment.

2️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/thyspace.git
cd thyspace
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
4️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the server directory with the following variables:

MONGO_URI – Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/thyspace)
PORT (optional, defaults to 5000)
JWT_SECRET (for authentication, choose a secure value)
5️⃣ Run the Application
# In one terminal, start the backend
cd server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, start the frontend
cd ../client
npm start
Then open http://localhost:3000 to explore ThySpace.
