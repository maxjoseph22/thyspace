## üè∞ ThySpace üè∞

# Overview

ThySpace is a medieval-themed social networking web application inspired by Facebook. We developed it during our time at Makers as part of a collaborative bootcamp project. This was the first time we tackled JavaScript and React after just two weeks of learning the basics of both.

Our primary goal was to explore core web development concepts (routing, data models, user authentication, etc.) and sharpen our React skills by building a fun, fully functional web application.

# Context and Motivation

- Focus on Learning: Coming from limited JavaScript and React experience, we dove right in to learn how to build a front end using React components, state management, and basic - integration with a backend API.
- Team Collaboration: Working in small groups strengthened our communication, version control, and agile practices.
- Medieval Twist: We gave our social network a medieval flair‚Äîfeaturing ‚Äúalliances‚Äù (friends) and thematic design elements‚Äîto keep the project engaging while we refined our new skills.

# Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can sign up and log in securely.
- Alliances (Friendships): Forge alliances with other users or break them if conflicts arise.
- Posts (Wall Messages): Share posts on your page with your kingdom and allies.
- Comments: Add witty or helpful comments on others‚Äô posts.
- Real-time Updates: Experience a seamless user interface that updates without page reloads.

# Tech Stack

- MongoDB: Database for users, alliances, posts, and comments.
- Express.js: Handles server-side logic and routing.
- React: Front-end library for building an interactive user interface.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime that powers the server and overall app logic.
